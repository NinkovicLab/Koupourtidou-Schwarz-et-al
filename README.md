# Koupourtidou-Schwarz-et-al

Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics of all cells in the mouse cerebral cortex in response to brain injury.

# Code

To run the case study, several packages must be installed. As both R and python packages are required, we prefer using a conda environment. To facilitate the setup of a conda environment, we have provided the environment_scRNAseq.yml (single cell analysis) and  environment_stRNAseq.yml (spatial analysis) files, which contains all conda and pip installable dependencies.
